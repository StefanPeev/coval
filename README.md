# Coval
**Coval** is a part of the project **LOCAL FONTS** for development of <code>free-to-use fonts</code> with the modern Bulgarian letterform model in Cyrillic code range. The project as a whole is based on an existing fonts under licenses which permit modifications and derivative works. Especially Coval is a derivative work of cm-unicode fonts version 0.7.0, licensed under [OFL.txt](OFL.txt).

### The initial issue of Coval
The initial issue of Coval was a font family with 22 fonts (11 weight from thin to black and corresponding italics). In this issue the base range of the Cyrillic glyphs (uni0410:uni044F) represents the modern Bulgarian letterform model. The international/traditional Cyrillic letterform model is included as a local feature for Russian language. This issue (versions 1.0-2.0) was published on https://fontlibrary.org.

### Coval on Github
The version of Coval on Github is the latest one. There are a lot of changes in Coval project on Github: the number of fonts in the font family is reduced, the international/traditional Cyrillic is again the Cyrillic by default and the modern Bulgarian letterform model is included as a local feature for Bulgarian users. No less important are the changes in the design of the glyphs (their style, structure, metrics). The aim of the project is Coval to have not only extended glyphs' quantity but a new design style. Any help in this direction is welcome.
